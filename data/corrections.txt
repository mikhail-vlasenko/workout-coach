# PREPARATION (Setup Position)

1. Bar in front of mid-foot:
"Let's position that bar right over your mid-foot - think shoelaces!"

2. Bar too close to shins:
"Give yourself a bit more space - your shins should touch the bar only after you bend down"

3. Shoulders behind bar:
"Bring those shoulders slightly forward - they should be right above the bar"

4. Hips too low:
"Think hip-hinge, not squat - let those hips rise a bit"

5. Hips too high:
"Bend those knees a bit more - you'll engage your legs better"

6. Arms not vertical:
"Let's get those arms hanging straight down like pillars"

7. Shins not touching bar:
"Bend your knees until your shins gently kiss the bar"

8. Lower back rounding:
"Proud chest! Feel that natural curve in your lower back"

9. Upper back excessive rounding:
"Pull those shoulders back slightly - think about squeezing an orange between your shoulder blades"

10. Head tilted up:
"Keep your eyes focused about 6 feet ahead on the floor - your neck will thank you"

11. Head tilted down:
"Lift that gaze just a bit - look a few feet ahead of you"

12. Grip too wide:
"Bring those hands in closer - about shoulder width apart"

13. Grip too narrow:
"Slide those hands out to shoulder width - give yourself a stable base"

14. Stance too wide:
"Bring those feet in to hip width - you'll be more powerful"

15. Stance too narrow:
"Give yourself a bit more base - feet hip width apart"

16. Asymmetrical foot placement:
"Line up those feet evenly - symmetry is strength"

17. Uneven grip width:
"Let's even out that grip - both hands same distance from center"

18. Hyperextended lower back:
"Relax that arch a bit - think neutral spine"

# WAY UP (Concentric Phase)

19. Hips rising before chest:
"Rise like an elevator - chest and hips together"

20. Bar path not vertical:
"Draw a straight line to the ceiling with that bar"

21. Bar drifting away:
"Keep that bar close - it should brush against your legs"

22. Arms bent during pull:
"Keep those arms straight and strong - they're just hooks"

23. Knees caving:
"Push those knees out slightly - make room for your arms"

24. Asymmetrical pull:
"Rise evenly - like a perfectly balanced elevator"

25. Heels rising:
"Root those heels down - they're your foundation"

26. Lower back losing neutral:
"Maintain that proud chest throughout the pull"

27. Head position changing:
"Keep your gaze steady - pick a spot and stick with it"

# LOCKOUT (Top Position)

28. Excessive lean back:
"Stand tall and proud - no need to lean back"

29. Incomplete hip lockout:
"Stand up tall - squeeze those glutes!"

30. Incomplete knee lockout:
"Straighten those legs completely - own the lockout"

31. Shrugging shoulders:
"Let those shoulders relax down - no need to shrug"

32. Shoulders rolled forward:
"Stand tall with proud chest - shoulders back and down"

# WAY DOWN (Eccentric Phase)

33. Bar swinging away:
"Guide that bar straight down - like it's on rails"

34. Knees blocking bar path:
"Push those hips back first - make room for the bar"

35. Lower back rounding during descent:
"Keep that chest proud on the way down"

36. Not maintaining vertical bar path:
"The bar should travel the same path down as it went up"

37. Dropping the weight:
"Control that descent - you're still building strength on the way down"

38. Bending knees too early:
"Hips back first, then bend those knees once the bar passes them"
