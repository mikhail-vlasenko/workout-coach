Grip width: narrow, hands about shoulder-width apart
Grip: thumbs around bar, bar close to fingers, both palms facing you
Arms: vertical when looking from the front, slightly incline from the side
Elbows: locked before and during the pull, until lockout. Never bent.
Chest: up to avoid back rounding, do NOT squeeze your shoulder-blades

Shoulders: in front of the bar from the side view, relax your shoulders and traps
Shoulder-blades: over your mid-foot when looking from the side, don’t squeeze them!
Head: inline with the rest of your spine, don’t look up, don’t look at your feet either
Hips: setup looks like a half Squat, hips higher than parallel. Don’t Squat your Deadlifts
Setup: bar over mid-foot, shoulder-blades over bar, straight line from head to lower back
Breathing: take a big breath at the bottom, hold it at the top, exhale at the bottom, repeat
Way up: don’t jerk the bar off the floor, pull slowly while dragging the bar over your legs
Way down: hips back first, bend your legs mostly once the bar reaches your knees
Between Reps: don’t bounce, rest a second, lift your chest, breathe, pull again
Traps: let them hang, relaxed. Don’t shrug or roll your shoulders at the top
Knees: push them to the sides on the way up, lock them at the top
Shins: touch the bar with your shins during your Deadlift setup
Lockout: lock your hips and knees. Don’t lean back at the top
